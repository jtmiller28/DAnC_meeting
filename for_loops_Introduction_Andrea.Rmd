#### A. Why use the `for()` loop?
Imagine trying to do an iterative process over a large dataset - 
```{r}
install.packages("vegan", dependences = TRUE) # install vegan package

library(vegan) # call vegan package
library(tidyverse)

data(dune) # load dataset within the vegan package

help("dune") # learn more about this data set
# The dune meadow vegetation data, dune, has cover class values of 30 species (columns) on 20 sites (rows). 

# Perhaps I want to know the abundance of each plant species across these sites: 
sum(dune[, 1]) # the sum function "sums" our provided argument, which calls the first column of the dune dataset by indexing (using the brackets)

## what if we wanted to sum the first row instead? how would that code change? 
sum(dune[, 2])
sum(dune[, 3])
sum(dune[, 4])
sum(dune[, 5])
sum(dune[, 6])
sum(dune[, 7])
#remember there are 30 total columns... is this the most efficient way to do something? 

#Now what would a for loop look like?

 # a holding vector (we'll explain this date)
holding.vector <- rep(NaN, ncol(dune))
holding.vector
#notice the curly brackets we talked about!
for(i in 1:length(holding.vector)) { 
  holding.vector[i] <- sum(dune[,i]) 
  
}
#the for loop is much less code!
 
```
