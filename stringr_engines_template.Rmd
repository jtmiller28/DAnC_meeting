```

```{r}
library(stringr)
```



### Engines is stringr are used to describe patterns     

#### Fixed matches: fixed(x) only matches exact sequences specified by x 
```{r}
a1 <- "\u00e1" #Single character with accent mark
a2 <- "a\u0301" # creates "a" and then adds a accent mark to that 

```
### Using coll() to fix this, coll() is a collation search. 
```{r}

```


```{r}
a <- c("\u00e1", "A\u0301", "a\u0301", "a\u0302") # Store alternative forms of the same thing
a




```

Boundary: boundary() matches boundaries between characters, lines, sentences, and words.
```{r}
x <- "This is a sentence."
str_split(x, boundary("word")) #Splits up the string with whitespace by word




```
